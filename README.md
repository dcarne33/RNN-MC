# How to use
In the src folder contains python file and a folder titled 'RNN_Model'. To run the RNN, open the Main.py file where comments detail how to run the program. The Main.py file, RNN.py file, and RNN_Model folder must all be in the same directory. The RNN_Model folder ocntains all the weights and biases for the RNN.
# About
The RNN here is trained on 224,000 plane-parallel Monte Carlo simulations across a broad range of optical properties.
